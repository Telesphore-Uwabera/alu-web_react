# TypeScript Project

This repository demonstrates the learning and implementation of TypeScript concepts through various tasks. Each task focuses on a different aspect of TypeScript such as interfaces, classes, modules, typing, and configuration management with Webpack.

## Task 0 - TypeScript Setup

In this task, we configured the basic TypeScript setup, including the creation of configuration files like `tsconfig.json` and `webpack.config.js`. These files ensure proper compilation of TypeScript code and bundling with Webpack.

- **Files Created**:
  - `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.
  - `webpack.config.js`: Webpack configuration file for module bundling.
  - `package.json`: Configuration for dependencies and build scripts.

## Task 1 - Class & Interface with Method

This task focuses on creating TypeScript classes and interfaces. It involved defining interfaces for subjects like `Cpp`, `Java`, and `React` with properties such as `teacher` and methods like `getRequirements` and `getAvailableTeacher`.

- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Defining interfaces.
  - Creating classes that implement interfaces.
  - Using methods in classes.

---

## Task 2 - Advanced Types

Task 2 introduced more advanced TypeScript features, such as type narrowing and union types. This task worked on subjects like `Cpp`, `Java`, and `React` while using these advanced features to manage different scenarios with subjects and teachers.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Type narrowing.
  - Union types.
  - Method overloading.

---

## Task 3 - Interface & Module

In Task 3, we worked with creating and importing/exporting modules. We created an interface `Teacher` and exported it from a module. This task helped us understand how to manage TypeScript modules in a project.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Exporting and importing TypeScript modules.
  - Using interfaces in modules.

---

## Task 4 - Subject Management with TypeScript

In this task, we focused on managing subjects and assigning teachers. We created constants for `Cpp`, `Java`, and `React` subjects, each with a teacher assigned. We logged relevant details to the console and practiced managing multiple subjects in TypeScript.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Creating constants.
  - Assigning values to properties.
  - Logging information to the console.

---

## Task 5 - Brand Convention & Nominal Typing

Task 5 focused on using brand convention and nominal typing in TypeScript. We created two interfaces `MajorCredits` and `MinorCredits` to represent different types of credits, each with a brand property. We also implemented functions to sum the credits and return the correct value.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Nominal typing.
  - Brand convention.
  - Type safety in TypeScript.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Telesphore-Uwabera/alu-web_react.git
cd alu-web_react/TypeScript
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
