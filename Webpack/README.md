# Task 3: Webpack Setup for Development and Production

This is the third task in setting up Webpack for managing the assets of a web project. It focuses on configuring Webpack to split the project into multiple modules (header, body, and footer) and configuring the development server and production build processes.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following folders:

- `modules/`: Contains the JavaScript and CSS files for each section of the page.
  - `header/`: Contains `header.js` and `header.css`
  - `body/`: Contains `body.js` and `body.css`
  - `footer/`: Contains `footer.js` and `footer.css`
- `public/`: Generated by Webpack and contains the final build files (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
   cd Webpack
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, which runs the project locally and automatically opens the browser, use the following command:

```bash
npm run start-dev
```

This will:
- Start a local development server on `http://localhost:8564/`.
- Serve the project with `webpack-dev-server`.
- Open the browser automatically.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will:
- Compile the project and optimize the bundles.
- Generate the necessary JavaScript and HTML files in the `public/` folder.

## Features Implemented

- **Multiple Modules**: The project is divided into three main sections: header, body, and footer.
  - Each section has its own CSS and JavaScript files.
- **Webpack Configuration**:
  - Development mode with source maps for better debugging.
  - Production mode for optimized bundles.
  - Automatic HTML generation using `html-webpack-plugin`.
  - Cleaning the build folder before each build using `clean-webpack-plugin`.
- **Development Server**:
  - Configured using `webpack-dev-server` to serve the project and live-reload changes.
  - Hot module replacement for a better development experience.

## Modules

### Header

- **header.js**: Imports `jQuery`, adds the logo, and displays the title "Holberton Dashboard".
- **header.css**: Styles the header section.

### Body

- **body.js**: Imports `jQuery` and `Lodash`, adds a button and counter functionality.
- **body.css**: Styles the body section.

### Footer

- **footer.js**: Imports `jQuery`, adds the copyright text "Copyright - Holberton School".
- **footer.css**: Styles the footer section.

## Webpack Plugins Used

- **html-webpack-plugin**: Automatically generates an `index.html` file and injects the bundles.
- **clean-webpack-plugin**: Cleans the `public/` folder before each build to ensure fresh builds.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Make sure all dependencies are installed by running `npm install`.
- Check for any missing dependencies in the `package.json` file.
- Review the terminal output for error details.
